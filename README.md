# CLIProject
Command-line interface system built in Java with Oracle DB integration. Supports dynamic command management, authenticated user access, and secure client-server communication.

- All commands are executed on the server, not the client.
- Only authenticated users can connect and run commands.
- Commands are stored in an Oracle database, allowing dynamic updates without modifying Java code.
- The system supports multiple clients, session-based access control, and modular command dispatching.
